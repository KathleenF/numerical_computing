\section*{Residues}

We will now introduce another form of series representation of functions.
A Laurent series of a function is a series of the form
\[\sum_{n= -\infty}^{\infty} a_n (z-z_0)^n\]
It can be proven that
\[a_n = \frac{1}{2\pi i} \int_C \frac{f(z)}{(z-z_0)^{n+1}} dz\]
It can also be proven that this series representation is unique.
This sort of series can be generated whether or not $f$ has a singular point a $z_0$.
When $f$ does not have a singularity at $z_0$ this representation degenerates to a normal Taylor Series (with the derivatives evaluated by the formula for the $n$th derivative of an analytic function).
Where $C$ is a contour which passes counterclockwise around the singularity exactly once.
This is called Laurent's Theorem.
By analyzing the convergence of this series, we see that it will either converge for all points except possibly $z_0$ in the complex plane, converge on an annulus about $z_0$, or not converge at all.

The built in function \li{sympy.series} can evaluate the series expansion of a function at a singularity, for example
\begin{lstlisting}
import sympy as sy
z = sy.Symbol('z')
(1/sy.sin(z)).series(z,0,8)
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{problem}
Write a python function which takes $f$, $z_0$, the lowest power term in the Laurent Series, and the highest power term in the Laurent Series and returns a callable function for the desired series.
Choose a small circle around $z_0$ as the contour on which to integrate ( remember, it doesn't matter what contour you use, as long as $z_0$ is inside it).
Also have your function return an array with the coefficients so that you can compare your function against \li{sympy.series}.
\end{problem}

which evaluates the series expansion of the $\csc(z)$ at $z=0$. 
As is the case with Taylor Series, often the Laurent Series expansion of a function is not computed directly using it's integral definition.
It is, rather, obtained by substitution into known series.
For example,
\[e^z = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{z^n}{n!}\]
so we may say,
\[e^{1/z} = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n! z^n}\]

\begin{problem}
Find the Laurent Series expansion of the function $\frac{e^{z}}{z^2 +1}$
\end{problem}

The term corresponding to $n=-1$ in the Laurent Series expansion of a complex function $f$ about a singularity $z_0$ is called the residue of $f$ at $z_0$ and is often written $\Res{z=z_0} f(z)$.
From Laurent's Theorem, using $f$, $z_0$, and $C$ as defined above, we have that
\[\Res{z=z_0} f(z) = \frac{1}{2 \pi i} \int_C f(z) dz\]
Another major theorem in Complex Analysis is the residue theorem (Also called Cauchy's Residue Theorem) which states that for some contour $C$ which does not intersect itself and a function $f$ analytic on $C$ and on the interior of $C$ except for isolated singular points $z_1,...,z_n$, that 
\[\int_C f(z) dz = 2 \pi i \sum_{k=1}^{n} \Res{z=z_k} f(z)\]
This allows for the evaluation of integrals that might not be pleasant in other circumstances.
Here are a few definitions that are good to know when speaking of residues.
\begin{itemize}
\item A singular point $z_0$ is said to be an ``isolated singular point" of a function $f$ if no sequence of singular points of $f$ converges to it.
\item An isolated singular point $z_0$ is said to be a removable singular point of a function $f$ if there are no negative powers of $(z-z_0)$ in the Laurent series expansion of $f$.
\item An isolated singular point $z_0$ is said to be a pole of a function $f$ is there are finitely may terms containing negative powers of $(z-z_0)$ in the Laurent series expansion of $f$.
\item An isolated singular point $z_0$ is said to be an essential singular point of a function $f$ if there are infinitely many negative powers of $(z-z_0)$ in the Laurent series expansion of $f$.
\end{itemize}

\begin{problem}
There is a direct relationship between the partial fraction decomposition of the reciprocal of a polynomial and the residues of that function at its zeroes.
Show why this is true, and, using the Newton's method function you have already written, write a function which, given the coefficients for a polynomial, returns the coefficients for the partial fraction decomposition of its reciprocal with the zeroes corresponding to each coefficient.
\end{problem}

\section*{Evaluating Residues Using Limits and Derivatives}
Often it is faster to evaluate a residue using limits instead of its direct integral definition.
To see how this might be done, consider some function $f$ with a pole of order $1$ at $z_0$.
We say $f$ has a pole of order $n$ at $z_0$ if the first nonzero term in the Laurent Series expansion of is the term corresponding to $(z-z_0)^{-n}$.
In the case of our pole of order 1, we then have
\[f(z)=c_{-1}(z-z_0)^{-1}+c_0 (z-z_0)^{0} +c_1 (z-z_0) + \dots\]
So,
\[f(z)(z-z_0)=c_{-1}+c_0 (z-z_0) + c_1 (z-z_0)^2 + \dots\]
Since the right hand side of the Laurent series converges within some nonzero distance of $z_0$, this series will also converge on that domain.
It is an ordinary power series, so it will also be continuous on that domain (it will actually be analytic, but continuity is sufficient here).
This means that we may take the limit of this expression as $z$ approaches $z_0$.
Taking this limit, the only nonzero term of the series remaining is $c_{-1}$, so we have
\[\lim_{z\to z_0} f(z)(z-z_0) = c_{-1} = \Res{z=z_0} f(z)\]
Now for some $f(z)$ with a pole of order $n$ at $z_0$ we have that within some nonzero distance of $z_0$, the Laurent series of $f$ converges and is of the form
\[f(z)=c_{-n}(z-z_0)^{-n}+\dots+c_0+c_1(z-z_0)+\dots\]
Multiplying by $(z-z_0)^{n}$ and differentiating $n-1$ times, we have
\[\frac{d^{n-1}}{dz^{n-1}}(f(z)(z-z_0)^{n})=(n-1)! c_{-1} + \frac{n!}{1!} c_0 (z-z_0) + \frac{(n+1)!}{2} c_1 (z-z_0)^2!+\dots\]
Taking the limit, we have
\[\lim_{z\to z_0}\frac{d^{n-1}}{dz^{n-1}}((z-z_0)^n f(z)) = (n-1)! c_{-1}\]
Which implies
\[\Res{z=z_0}f(z)=\frac{1}{(n-1)!}\lim_{z\to z_0}\frac{d^{n-1}}{dz^{n-1}}((z-z_0)^n f(z))\]
Another useful trick involving poles and residues involves the logarithmic residue, i.e. the residue of the logarithmic derivative $\frac{d}{dz}(\ln(f(z))) = \frac{f'(z)}{f(z)}$.
A natural consequence of the Laurent series expansion of $f(z)$ and $f'(z)$ at a pole $z_0$ is that, where $d$ is the degree of the pole at $z_0$ is that
\[- \Res{z=z_0} \frac{f'(z)}{f(z)} = d\]
This is a useful bit of information that may be used to simplify computation of residues or of the Laurent series expansion of a function.
Another way we can evaluate residues is by the following theorem.
\begin{theorem}
Let $f(z)=\frac{p(z)}{q(z)}$ and let $p$ and $q$ be holomorphic at $z_0$. Let $p(z_0) \neq 0$ and $q(z_0)=0$.
Suppose that $z_0$ is a pole of order $1$ of $f$.
Then
\[\Res{z=z_0} f(z) = \frac{p(z_0)}{q'(z_0)}\]
\end{theorem}

\begin{problem}
Write a Python function that given a function and one of it's poles uses \li{sympy.residue} to calculate the order of that pole and with that information calculate the residue of the function using symbolic limits and derivatives.
Verify that your function calculates the correct order and check the residue against \li{sympy.residue}, using the function
\[f(z) = \frac{1}{(z^+1)^{4}(2z+1)}dz\]
(The roots are somewhat obvious here, but as a note you can use \li{sympy.solve} to find the roots).
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
Write a python function, which, using symbolic integration in SymPy, returns the Laurent series expansion of a function about a given pole.
Use the trick involving logarithmic residues to figure out what the degree of the pole is, then use symbolic limits and derivatives to compute the coefficients of the corresponding Laurent series expansion (look at the original equation for the coefficients of the Laurent Series and see that they can be rewritten as residues).
You may assume that the pole is not an essential singular point.
(Recall that, as we defined it, a pole is not an essential singular point, so it will always have a finite degree).
\end{problem}

\section*{Evaluating Indefinite Integrals Using Residues}

One convenient use of residues is the evaluation of integrals that are difficult to evaluate symbolically in other ways.
Often, when we cannot directly assign a value to one of these integrals, residues can still help us evaluate the Cauchy principal value of the integral.
Recall that for an integral $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x)dx$ the Cauchy principal value is $\lim_{r\to \infty} \int_{-r}^{r} f(x) dx$.
This limit may exist, even though the limit itself may not.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{contour1.pdf}
\caption{A contour used for integration using residues.}
\label{complexint:c1}
\end{figure}

Consider the integral $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{z^2}{z^4+1}$. Let $f(z)=\frac{z^2}{z^4+1}$.
Notice that this function has poles at $e^{\frac{\pi i}{4}}$, $e^{\frac{3\pi i}{4}}$, $e^{\frac{5\pi i}{4}}$, and $e^{\frac{7\pi i}{4}}$.
For notation, let these be $p_1$, $p_2$, $p_3$, and $p_4$.
For some real $R>1$, consider the contour $C$ from $-R$ to $R$ and counterclockwise along the circle centered at $0$ of radius $R$ back to -$R$.

This contour ( a semi circle) is shown in Figure \ref{complexint:c1} with $R = 2$.
Let $A$ be this second portion of $C$.
Note that, since $R>1$ we have
\[\int_C f(z)dz = 2\pi i (\Res{z=p_0} f(z) +\Res{z=p_1} f(z))\]
So, rewriting, we have
\[\int_{-R}^R f(z) dz = 2\pi i (\Res{z=p_0} f(z) +\Res{z=p_1} f(z)) - \int_A f(z) dz\]
so
\[\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(z) dz = \lim_{R\to \infty} \int_{-R}^R f(z) dz = 2\pi i (\Res{z=p_0} f(z) +\Res{z=p_1} f(z)) - \lim_{R\to \infty} \int_A f(z) dz\]
We would like to show that that $\lim_{R\to\infty} \int_A f(z) dz = 0$, so note that on $A$, $\abs{z}=R$.
It follows from the triangle inequality that $\abs{z^4+1}\geq \abs{\abs{z}^4-1} = R^4 -1$, so we have that
\[\abs{\int_A f(z) dz}\leq \int_A \abs{f(z)} dz \leq \int_A \frac{R^2}{R^4 -1}dz = \pi R \frac{R^2}{R^4-1}\]
so $\lim_{R\to\infty} \int_A f(z) dz = 0$ as desired.
This then implies that
\[\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(z) dz = 2\pi i (\Res{z=p_0} f(z) +\Res{z=p_1} f(z))\]
Evaluating the residues at $p_0$ and $p_1$ we have
\[\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(z) dz = \frac{\pi}{\sqrt{2}}\]

\begin{problem}
Write a python function which, given the coefficients for the polynomials in the numerator and denominator of a rational function $f$, evaluates the sum
\[\sum 2\pi i (\Res{z=p} f(z))\]
over all poles $p$ of $f$ such that $Im(p)>0$.
Use that function to numerically evaluate the following integrals.
\[\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{z^2}{z^6+1}dz\]
\[\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{z^{12}-5z^{10}+3z^8-16z^6+4z^4-z^2-4}{4z^{14}+6z^6+12}dz\]
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
Similar arguments can be used to evaluate integrals of functions that can be compared to the rational functions in question.
Write a modified version of the function you just wrote and use it to evaluate the following integrals.
\[\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{cos(z)}{z^4+1}dz\]
\[\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{sin^2(z)}{z^{20}+1}dz\]
\end{problem}

The general conditions in which we may apply this particular way of evaluating integrals come from Jordan's Lemma, which states
\begin{lemma}[Jordan's Lemma]
If for some $f(z)$ on $\mathbb{C}$, $f$ is analytic for all points $z$ in the upper half plane such that $\abs{z}>R_0$ for some $R_0 \in \mathbb{R}$ where $R_0 >0$ and that, where $C_R$ denotes the semicircle $z=Re^{i\theta}$ for $0\leq \theta \leq \pi$, there exists some positive constant $M_R$ such that for all $z$ on $C_R$, $\abs{f(z)} \leq M_R$ and $\lim_{R \to \infty} M_R = 0$, then for every positive constant $a$, we have
\[\lim_{R \to \infty} \int_{C_R} f(z) e^{iaz} dz = 0\]
\end{lemma}

\begin{problem}
Use the function you just wrote to evaluate the Cauchy Principal Value of the integral
\[\int_{\infty}^{-\infty} \frac{z sin(z)}{z^2+1}\]
\end{problem}

If a function has a singularity on the real line, we can often still evaluate the value of $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(z) dz$ using a similar argument as before, but by indenting the path along the real axis around a small path around the singularity, then, as we take the limit as our outer contour moves out toward infinity, we can let the small contour around the singularity approach the singularity.
An example of a contour like this is shown in Figure \ref{complexint:c2}.
It is centered at the origin with $R=2$ on the outer circle and $R=\frac{1}{2}$ on the inner circle.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{contour2.pdf}
\caption{An example of a contour that has been modified to avoid a singularity along the real line.}
\label{complexint:c2}
\end{figure}

The following is a useful theorem involving these ``indented path" methods.
\begin{theorem}
Consider a function $f$ with a pole of order $1$ at $z=x_0$ with a Laurent series representation in a punctured disk of radius $R$ about $x_0$ and residue $B_0$ at $x_0$.
Let $C_r$ be the upper half of a circle $\abs{z-x_0}=r$ where $r<R$ oriented in the clockwise direction, then
\[\lim_{r\to 0} \int_{C_r} f(z) dz = - B_0 \pi i\]
\end{theorem}
As a consequence of this, for a function $f$ on $\mathbb{C}$ with only zeros of at most order $1$ on $\mathbb{R}$, where $A$ is the sum of the residues of $f$ on the upper half plane and $B$ is the sum of the residues of $f$ on $\mathbb{R}$,
\[CPV = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(z) dz = \pi i (B+2A)\]
When that Cauchy Principal Value exists.

\begin{problem}
Modify the function you wrote earlier to evaluate the CPV of $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(z) dz$ for a meromorphic function $f$ where $f$ has only poles of order $1$ along the real axis.

Then, using the function you just wrote, evaluate
\[\int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{sin(z)}{z} dz\]

Hint: Since $1/z$ and $sin(z)$ are odd, $\frac{sin(z)}{z}$ will be even, so
$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{sin(z)}{z} dz = 2 \int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{sin(z)}{z} dz$.
\end{problem}

Integration techniques using residues can also be extended to integration around branch points, some types of integrals involving sines and cosines, inverse Laplace transforms, and many other difficult integration problems.
